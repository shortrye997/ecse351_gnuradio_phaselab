# ECSE 351 GNU Radio Phase Lab

## Description
This project uses the GNU radio software and is based on the ecse 351 phase lab. What it essentially does is it allows the manipulation of the
phase, frequency, and amplitude of signals 1 and 2 in order to see the change in the product of those two signals. It shows graphs of
the three signals and their constellations of phase shift. I have included the ability to add noise through changing the noise amplitude.

## Getting Started
